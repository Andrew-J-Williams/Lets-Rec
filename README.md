# Let's Rec!
Let's Rec is a social network made for those who love sports. It is a web-based application created with Rails, React, and Redux. A user can create an account or sign into an existing account and discover what teams are located near them. Users can create teams, join existing teams, or leave teams they no longer can play with. Users can interact through creating posts on their specific team pages, allowing teammates to stay in contact and up to date. The idea behind Let's Rec is to connect like-minded individuals who want to stay in shape and socialize in their own cities. Our #1 goal in developing this application is having fun, so get out there and rec!
